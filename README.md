This is a repository of my final project for LING 2212 _Hieroglyphs to HTML: History of Writing_ at Cornell University.

For the project I wanted to make a novel typing system for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, a unique system where each character represents a consonant and the orientation of those characters represent the vowels.
One of my many interests is the process behind unicode and the [movement](https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/index.html ) to encode every known script in the world, and I wanted to find a way to incorporate the
encoded syllabics into my project. A "typing translator" of sorts is the final result. A full write up of the inspiration and description of how the program works is available on the pdf in this repository.
